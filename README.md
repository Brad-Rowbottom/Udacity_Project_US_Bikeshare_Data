### Udacity Bikeshare Project
In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. The project will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
- chicago.zip
- washington.zip
- new_york_city.zip
